    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab exercise, we are going to create a program that will break Diffie Hellman (DH) keys. The reason why we use Diffie Hellman and not RSA is that standard RSA requires a key-length of 1024 bits, which currently will require a lot of compute and time to break and not feasible for this lab.\n",
    "The Diffie Hellman algorithm does not have this minimal requirement and \"works\" with smaller key-lengths. Smaller key-lengths \"work\" but that does not mean they are secure.\n",

    "**Note**: Please add/edit your code in test.py and run it via a Terminal\n",

    "### Alice & Bob\n",
    "Alice and Bob would like to exchange a sensitive message message.\n",
    "By generating a shared key using Diffie Hellman (DH) they are able to encrypt the sensitive message with their shared secret and prevent others from eaves dropping.\n",

    "## General steps\n",

    "Please follow these generic steps for each of the following sections.\n",
    "* Copy the code into `test.py`\n",
    "* This file has a reference to a library file `labfuncs.py` where the actual functions used are located\n",
    "* Set a `bit_size` larger than 3\n",
    "* Run the program: `python test.py` from a terminal in the lab1 directory\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate initial keys\n",
    "There are specific requirements for DH thus we will write a program that will ensure this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice will start the process:\n",
    "* Alice generates `pub_prime_key`, a public prime number and `pub_base_key` a primitive root modulo of `pub_prime_key`.\n",
